Nova SDK Test App
=================

This is a bare-bones app for tinkering with the Nova SDK. It exposes all features of the SDK through a buttons on the UI and provides feedback.

If you're exploring or testing the SDK it's a good starting point. The code is intentionally minimal to act as an example in other apps.
